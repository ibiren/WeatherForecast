# WeatherForecast

XCode 8.2.1 was used building it, tested in iPhone 7 plus simulator.

Open .xcworspace file, as I am using cocoapods services(Alamofire, SwiftyJson, MBProgressHUD)

Limitations:
It only takes Capital City name in search field, if given wrong name it crashes, this is a last minute observation.

Improvents expected:
Structuring code, like keeping webservice and model separate is something is very much required in order to have clear segregation of code.
Using custom cell, more relevant information can be displayed.
Further more Google places api can be used to look for any area weather info!
